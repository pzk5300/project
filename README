Hurricane Monitoring and Evacuation Optimization System

Project Goals
Monitor real-time hurricane data (such as wind speed, trajectory, and category).
Predict hurricane paths using data analysis and forecasting models.
Optimize evacuation routes and highlight safe zones for affected populations.
Provide users with a user-friendly interface for data visualization and decision-making.

Key Features

Hurricane Monitoring:
Collect real-time data from public APIs like NOAA or OpenWeatherMap.
Display live updates of hurricane location and intensity on a map.

Path Prediction:
Use historical data and machine learning models to forecast the hurricaneâ€™s path.
Display forecasted paths on an interactive map.

Evacuation Planning:

Integrate geographical data to optimize evacuation routes based on traffic and shelter locations.
Provide step-by-step navigation instructions.
Interactive User Interface:

Visualize hurricane data and routes using tools like Plotly or Dash.
Provide notifications and alerts for updates.

Background Information
Hurricanes are among the most devastating natural disasters, causing widespread destruction to infrastructure, loss of life, and disruption of communities. Their unpredictability and intensity make them a significant challenge for disaster management and relief efforts. Efficient hurricane tracking and evacuation planning are critical for minimizing damage and ensuring public safety.
Existing solutions often focus on either monitoring hurricanes or providing evacuation routes, but few integrate these functionalities into a comprehensive system. Moreover, as urban areas grow and climate change contributes to more intense hurricanes, the need for innovative, efficient, and accessible solutions becomes even more pressing.
This project is meaningful because of its real world impact through disaster management, hurricane monitoring, and safe evacuation planning.
This project is also novel for its integration of these features, its prediction analysis, and its user-friendly accessibility.
