Background Information
Hurricanes are among the most devastating natural disasters, causing widespread destruction to infrastructure, loss of life, and disruption of communities. Their unpredictability and intensity make them a significant challenge for disaster management and relief efforts. Efficient hurricane tracking and evacuation planning are critical for minimizing damage and ensuring public safety.
Existing solutions often focus on either monitoring hurricanes or providing evacuation routes, but few integrate these functionalities into a comprehensive system. Moreover, as urban areas grow and climate change contributes to more intense hurricanes, the need for innovative, efficient, and accessible solutions becomes even more pressing.
This project is meaningful because of its real world impact through disaster management, hurricane monitoring, and safe evacuation planning.
This project is also novel for its integration of these features, its prediction analysis, and its user-friendly accessibility.

Time Updated: 2024-12-04 14:00 UTC
For visualization, a real-time map displayed the hurricane's current location and intensity using a color-coded system for different categories.
The achievement we made here is by having real-time data fetched accurately and updated every 10 minutes, ensuring users are informed about the latest conditions, which satisfied our project goals.

Discussions and Conclusions

Project issues -
Issues we ran into with the project is the availability of data. For some of the real time data sources, there is a subscription required. The accuracy of the application is also an issue because it is difficult for the program to predict and forecast over 48 hours. The limitations of the application include its predictability because it mainly accounts for historical data and future hurricanes can change due to the climate impact.

Course learning applied -
Throughout this project we used and applied what we learned from this course to include algorithms, basic data structure understanding, and how to install and run applications in python.
