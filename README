Hurricane Monitoring and Evacuation Optimization System

Project Goals
Monitor real-time hurricane data (such as wind speed, trajectory, and category).
Predict hurricane paths using data analysis and forecasting models.
Optimize evacuation routes and highlight safe zones for affected populations.
Provide users with a user-friendly interface for data visualization and decision-making.

Key Features

Hurricane Monitoring:
Collect real-time data from public APIs like NOAA or OpenWeatherMap.
Display live updates of hurricane location and intensity on a map.

Path Prediction:
Use historical data and machine learning models to forecast the hurricane’s path.
Display forecasted paths on an interactive map.

Evacuation Planning:

Integrate geographical data to optimize evacuation routes based on traffic and shelter locations.
Provide step-by-step navigation instructions.
Interactive User Interface:

Visualize hurricane data and routes using tools like Plotly or Dash.
Provide notifications and alerts for updates.

Background Information
Hurricanes are among the most devastating natural disasters, causing widespread destruction to infrastructure, loss of life, and disruption of communities. Their unpredictability and intensity make them a significant challenge for disaster management and relief efforts. Efficient hurricane tracking and evacuation planning are critical for minimizing damage and ensuring public safety.
Existing solutions often focus on either monitoring hurricanes or providing evacuation routes, but few integrate these functionalities into a comprehensive system. Moreover, as urban areas grow and climate change contributes to more intense hurricanes, the need for innovative, efficient, and accessible solutions becomes even more pressing.
This project is meaningful because of its real world impact through disaster management, hurricane monitoring, and safe evacuation planning.
This project is also novel for its integration of these features, its prediction analysis, and its user-friendly accessibility.

Installation and usage instructions

The prerequisities required are Python 3.8, pip, Git, and an internet connection.

You must first clone the repository by adding this command

git clone https://github.com/username/hurricane-monitoring-system.git
cd hurricane-monitoring-system

Install the libraries with pip

pip install -r requirements.txt

Setting up the API keys to gather real time hurricane and geographgical data 

HURRICANE_API_KEY=your_noaa_or_openweathermap_api_key
MAP_API_KEY=your_openstreetmap_api_key

Then run the application 

python run.py

Access the application through here 

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Through the application, you can view live hurricane data and also see predicted paths and the intensity of the storms. You can also input your location and it will generate safe evacuation routes. 

To test the application to ensure its functionality, you can input this command

python -m unittest discover tests/
